# Assignment 05: Advanced Raytracing

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Advanced Raytracing" assignment, a fascinating journey into the world of computer graphics. This project is part of our course curriculum, where I explore the art of creating realistic renderings of 3D scenes, texture mapping and rendering implicit surfaces using raytracing techniques.

## Assignment Details

- Comprehensive assignment requirements and guidelines can be found in [assignment05.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-05%20(bonus)%20Advanced%20raytracing/Assignment05.pdf).
- My detailed report, which includes my implementation insights and findings, is available in [report.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-05%20(bonus)%20Advanced%20raytracing/report.pdf).


## Project Highlights

### 1. Texture Mapping

- Implemented texture mapping for primitive shapes supported by the raytracer.
- Objects are shaded according to a customized shading model.

### 2. Ray Marching for Implicit Surfaces

- Implemented a raytracer capable of rendering implicit surfaces.
- Utilized a ray marching algorithm to trace rays through these implicit surfaces.
