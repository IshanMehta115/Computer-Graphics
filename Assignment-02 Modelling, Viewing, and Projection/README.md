# Assignment-02: Modelling, Viewing, and Projection

## Project Overview

This assignment, titled "Modelling, Viewing, and Projection," is part of our course curriculum and focuses on fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including camera manipulation, perspective projection, and perspective transformation. In this project, we explored various camera views and projections and gained a deeper understanding of 3D scenes.

## Assignment Details

- The detailed assignment requirements and guidelines can be found in [assignment02.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-02%20Modelling%2C%20Viewing%2C%20and%20Projection/Assignment02.pdf).
- My comprehensive report, which includes my implementation, findings, and answers to theoretical questions, is available in [report.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-02%20Modelling%2C%20Viewing%2C%20and%20Projection/Report.pdf).

## Features and Objectives

This assignment consists of several key components and objectives:

1. **Camera View Manipulation**
   - I programmed the arrow keys on the keyboard to change the camera view of the scene.
   - The viewing matrix is updated after every change in the camera center.

2. **Camera Positioning**
   - I explored specific camera positions to generate one-point perspective, two-point perspective, and two three-point perspective views (bird’s eye view and rat’s eye view).

3. **Projection Types**
   - I implemented the ability to switch between orthographic and perspective projections using specific arrow keys.

4. **Projection for Elevation Views**
   - I used arrow keys to move the camera to specific positions to generate top view, front elevation, and side elevation perspectives.

5. **Theoretical Questions**
   - I also provided answers to theoretical questions related to the theory of perspective transformation.
