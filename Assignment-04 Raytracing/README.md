# Assignment 04: Raytracing

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Raytracing" assignment, a fascinating journey into the world of computer graphics. This project is part of our course curriculum, where I explore the art of creating realistic renderings of 3D scenes using raytracing techniques.

## Assignment Details

- Comprehensive assignment requirements and guidelines can be found in [assignment04.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-04%20Raytracing/Assignment04.pdf).
- My detailed report, which includes my implementation insights and findings, is available in [report.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-04%20Raytracing/Report.pdf).

## Key Features and Objectives

In this assignment, I delved into the exciting world of raytracing and achieved the following key objectives:

1. **Rendering Geometric Shapes**
   - I successfully implemented a raytracer capable of rendering geometric shapes such as triangles and spheres. These shapes serve as fundamental building blocks in computer graphics.

2. **Blinn-Phong Shading**
   - To enhance the visual appeal of our rendered objects, I incorporated the Blinn-Phong shading model. This shading model accounts for the reflection of light and simulates effects like specular highlights and diffuse reflections.

3. **Shadows**
   - Realism in computer graphics involves the correct representation of shadows. I took on the challenge of implementing shadows in our raytracer, ensuring that objects cast realistic shadows on other surfaces.
