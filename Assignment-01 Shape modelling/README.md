- The detailed report of our implementation and findings can be accessed in [report.pdf](https://github.com/IshanMehta115/Computer-Graphics/blob/main/Assignment-01%20Shape%20modelling/Report.pdf).

## Sphere Generation

In the first part of the assignment, we delve into the mathematics behind sphere creation. We utilize parametric equations to model a sphere in three-dimensional space. This exercise enhanced our understanding of geometric shapes and equations in computer graphics.

## Piecewise Bezier Curves

The second part of the assignment involves exploring Piecewise Bezier curves. These curves are invaluable in computer graphics for their ability to smoothly represent complex shapes and animations. We studied their properties and application.
